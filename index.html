                    <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Having gained a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and object-oriented programming, I embarked on my programming journey during my college years. Within a year and a half, I pursued numerous courses and began honing my development skills.</p>

                    <p>In 2022,  I started freelancing on mostaql, devoting my free time to various projects for clients. During this period, I gained valuable practical experience and expanded my expertise further.</p>

                    <p>In August of that year, I had an internship in (Back-end python & Django development), further augmenting my skill set and deepening my knowledge in this domain.

                    <hr>
                    <p>In my role as a full stack developer.</p>
                    <p>I have been involved in the design, development, testing, and management of various web applications. One of my preferred stacks is the Django stack, which I find to be highly effective and reliable.</p>

                    <h5>What I Know</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Python, Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Postgres and APIs such as google maps,
                    Git and a hole punch more I can't possibly mention in one sentence! ;)</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Reverse Engineering, Build Ugly Prototypes First & AI.</p>
                    <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the
                    code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do.  Additionally, with the assistance of AI technologies, such as chat-based GPT models, I am able to expedite the learning process. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>After almost two years of developing projects and acquiring valuable experience in this field, I'm ready to learn something new. I'll
                    collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my <a href="https://dev.to/adhamhe6" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my proficiency in building small-scale projects, I am driven to secure a position within a larger team, where I can contribute & learn from individuals who possess more extensive expertise than my own.</p>
